Cerebral is an Financial Investment Analysis Application providing simple financial investment advice for a given retail industry.

Cerebral can build a portfolio by clustering retail industries, giving unbiased, sound financial advice. Cerebral achives its goal by combining the AI techniques, database and networking components which are clustered to provide higher computational power. 

A portfolio is viewed by cerebrals client program. Cerebral servers are always left on.
